# CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED

## 1. Fix Tags and Attachments Attributes in Appwrite Console

**Go to your Appwrite Console:**
https://nyc.cloud.appwrite.io/console/project-68eb93bd001d103c48c5

**Navigate to:** Databases → Your Database → tasks collection → Attributes

**IMPORTANT: DELETE the current "tags" and "attachments" attributes and recreate them:**

**NEW "tags" attribute:**
- Type: String
- Size: 100
- Array: NO (this is the key change!)
- Required: NO

**NEW "attachments" attribute:**
- Type: String  
- Size: 500
- Array: NO (this is the key change!)
- Required: NO

## 2. Fix Storage Bucket Permissions

**Go to:** Storage → Your Bucket (68eb9c64001e782fbb3a) → Settings → Permissions

**Add these permissions:**
- **Read**: `user:*`
- **Create**: `user:*` 
- **Update**: `user:*`
- **Delete**: `user:*`

## 3. Quick Test - Disable File Uploads Temporarily

I've already disabled file attachments in the code to focus on getting basic task creation working first.

## 4. Try Creating a Task Again

After fixing the tags attribute, try creating a task with:
- Title: "Test Task"
- Description: "Test Description" 
- Tags: "test,demo" (keep it simple)
- No file attachments for now

This should work!
