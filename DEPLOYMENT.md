# Deployment Guide for Appwrite Cloud Sites

This guide will help you deploy your Personal Task Manager to Appwrite Cloud Sites.

## Prerequisites

1. Your Appwrite project is fully configured (database, storage, authentication)
2. Your application is working locally
3. You have admin access to your Appwrite project

## Build Process

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Make sure your `.env` file has the correct production values:

```env
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_production_project_id
VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your_production_database_id
VITE_APPWRITE_STORAGE_ID=your_production_storage_id
```

### 3. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with all the optimized files.

### 4. Verify Build
```bash
npm run preview
```

Test the production build locally to ensure everything works correctly.
